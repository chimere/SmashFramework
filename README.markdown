SMASH CORE FRAMEWORK
====================

Welcome to the [Smash Framework](http://www.smash.io)!

Smash Engine is a framework for Flash game development. Build your game 
with reusable gameplay, physics, rendering - some 
written by others, and some written by you. There are lots of great libraries 
for game development on Flash, and Smash Engine helps you use them more 
effectively.

Smash Framework is a fork of the popular PushButton Engine (version 2.0).  PushButton Engine was used by PushButton Labs, Playdom, Zynga, Hive7, ZaaLabs and other developers in commercial games.

Unfortunately, PushButton Labs [closed its doors](http://pushbuttonlabs.com/) in late 2011.  Smash Framework is the same commercial grade engine you're used to with PushButton Engine.
